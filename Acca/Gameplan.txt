Structured Development Plan for Acca

1. Define and Prioritize Features

Goal: Ensure clarity on what needs to be built and in what order.

Steps:

Break down the game design document into essential features (e.g., player movement, property management, region control).

Assign priority levels to features:

Critical: Core gameplay mechanics like grid navigation, turn system, and properties.

Important: Regional control, population happiness, and businesses.

Optional: Chance events, multiplayer, and sabotage.

Create a timeline for each feature, balancing complexity and dependencies.

2. Prepare the Field

Goal: Set up the game environment with foundational elements.

Steps:

Grid Layout:

Use Cell.cs to build a grid-based board.

Ensure cells are linked correctly using the LinkNeighbors function in GameManager.cs.

Player Setup:

Implement the Player script to handle player-specific data (money, properties, region control).

Assign starting positions on the grid.

Turn Logic:

Use TurnManager.cs to manage turn flow but refactor it as a property of the player.

Ensure smooth transitions between turns with clear player-specific actions.

3. Implement Core Mechanics

Goal: Build the fundamental systems that define gameplay.

Steps:

Player Movement:

Update PlayerMovement.cs to integrate with TurnManager.

Add visual feedback for valid movement paths and player actions.

Property System:

Expand Cell.cs to support properties:

bool isOwned, Player owner, int propertyValue.

Create methods for buying, selling, and upgrading properties.

Display ownership visually on the grid (e.g., color overlays or markers).

Business Management:

Create a Business class to manage types, resource needs, and income generation.

Link businesses to properties and require resources for maintenance.

4. Build Regional and Population Systems

Goal: Introduce regions and population dynamics for deeper strategy.

Steps:

Region Assignment:

Group cells into regions using unique identifiers in GameManager.cs.

Track regional value and ownership based on properties and businesses.

Population Mechanics:

Add a Population class to each region to track size and happiness.

Use population data to determine available employees for businesses and tax income.

Implement migration logic:

Happiness affects movement between regions.

Link migration to player decisions like tax rates and amenities.

5. Develop Interaction Systems

Goal: Facilitate trading, events, and adversarial actions between players.

Steps:

Trading System:

Create menus for resource and property trading between players.

Include negotiation mechanics or auction options for contested properties.

Chance Events:

Define event types (e.g., economic booms, natural disasters).

Trigger events through chance cells or random rolls during turns.

Sabotage Mechanics:

Allow limited actions to disrupt opponents (e.g., disabling businesses temporarily).

Implement penalties for overuse to balance gameplay.

6. Add Feedback and Polish

Goal: Enhance player experience with visuals, audio, and UI elements.

Steps:

Visuals:

Highlight active cells and properties during movement or interaction.

Use color-coded regions and player indicators.

UI:

Create dashboards to track player stats (money, properties, businesses).

Add menus for adjusting taxes, managing businesses, and trading.

Audio:

Include sound effects for movement, purchases, and events.

Add background music to match gameplay phases.

7. Test and Iterate

Goal: Ensure the game is balanced, fun, and bug-free.

Steps:

Conduct internal playtests after each development phase.

Adjust mechanics based on player feedback, focusing on balance and usability.

Simulate edge cases (e.g., low population, high taxes) to ensure systems respond appropriately.

8. Plan for Expansion

Goal: Leave room for additional features post-launch.

Steps:

Identify potential expansions like new regions, events, or multiplayer modes.

Modularize code to allow future features to integrate seamlessly.
